This project has the objective of building a basic recipe website.

This project has helped me reinforce my knowledge in the following areas:

1. Working with HTML boilerplates
2. Using the HTML elements related to ordered and unordered list 
3. Using the img element along with its most important attributes to insert images to an HTML file
4. Working with anchor elements and its source attribute to link to another page within my website.
5. Working with git and github, using the command line to stage, commit and push changes to a remote repository
